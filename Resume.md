## At the very end.
The skills mentioned above are only the ones I can think of when I'm writing this résumé. As I've said in the beginning, I'm a fast learner and I've learnt many different and interesting technologies, however, since I'm still studying at university, I only got a few chances to participate in a project within a collaborating environment. So I'm very excited to join the team.
